# Connect-Four---Human-vs-Human
This C++ implementation of Connect Four offers a classic two-player board game experience. Players take turns dropping colored pieces into a 6x7 grid, aiming to connect four pieces in a row either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. The game dynamically updates the board with each move, checking for win conditions or draws.
